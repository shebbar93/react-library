      "author": "Sylvia Plath",
      "description": "The Bell Jar is the only novel written by the American writer and poet Sylvia Plath. Originally published under the pseudonym 'Victoria Lucas' in 1963, the novel is semi-autobiographical, with the names of places and people changed. The book is often regarded as a roman Ã  clef because the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's own experiences with what may have been clinical depression or bipolar II disorder. Plath died by suicide a month after its first UK publication"
